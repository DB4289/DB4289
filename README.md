👋 Hi, I'm Daniel (@DB4289)

👀 I'm fascinated by the power of data to improve our world. I love exploring how web development and machine learning can be combined to create innovative, data-driven solutions. In my free time, you'll find me hitting the gym, indulging in a good book, or occasionally getting lost in a captivating game. 🏋️‍♂️📚🎮

🌱 I'm currently diving deep into C#, ASP.NET Core, and the exciting world of ML.NET.  I'm eager to apply these skills to build intelligent and impactful web applications.

💞️ I'm always open to collaborating on projects that involve data analysis, machine learning, or web development.  Let's connect and build something awesome together!
